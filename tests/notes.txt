set an upper and lower limit, such as 50, which would give a range of 100, from 50 to - 50

set a limmit for the beginning and the end
    that way you can then find the range from the upper and lower limit, divide that by the number of blocks
then use each one to lower the range over time

say the limit is 50

passing in an arc, the highest number is 15

divide 50 by 15 then times each number in the arc by that number,

modify this over time by using the modifier from above




the main plot for a novel would have an upper and lower of 50 from beginning to end
    then for each story after that it would lower dramatically
    
    
on that note, when you pass in a timeline, you will also need to pass in what story is the MAIN 
that way it will rise into the main, be at the upper and lower for the main, then down again afterwards
